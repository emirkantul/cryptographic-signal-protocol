# cryptographic-signal-protocol</br>
  </br>
  Sabanci University cryptography project to develop a simplified version of the Signal Protocol, which provides forward secrecy and deniability. This project will insight for a practical cryptographic protocol, a variant of which is used in different applications such as WhatsApp.
</br>
</br>
The project has three phases:</br>
## Phase I: Developing software for the Public Key Registration</br>
## Phase II: Developing software for receiving messages from other clients </br>
## Phase III: Developing software to communicate with other clients</br>
</br>
</br>
## Phase I: Developing software for the Public Key Registration</br>
In this protocol, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used in key exchange protocol and digital signature algorithm with NIST-256 curve. You should select “secp256k1” for the elliptic curve in your python code. There are three types of public keys; Identity Key (IK), Signed Pre-key (SPK) and One-time Pre-key (OTK).
