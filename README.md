# cryptographic-signal-protocol</br>

Sabanci University cryptography project to develop a simplified version of the Signal Protocol, which provides forward secrecy and deniability. This project will insight for a practical cryptographic protocol, a variant of which is used in different applications such as WhatsApp.
</br>
</br>

**The project has three phases:**</br>

## Phase I: Developing software for the Public Key Registration</br>

## Phase II: Developing software for receiving messages from other clients </br>

## Phase III: Developing software to communicate with other clients</br>

</br>
</br>

## Phase I: Developing software for the Public Key Registration</br>

In this protocol, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used in key exchange protocol and digital signature algorithm with NIST-256 curve. “secp256k1” selected for the elliptic curve in python code. There are three types of public keys; Identity Key (IK), Signed Pre-key (SPK) and One-time Pre-key (OTK).
</br>
</br>

## Phase II: Developing software for receiving messages from other clients</br>

Developing a software for downloading five (5) messages from the server, which were uploaded to the server originally by a pseudo-client. end-to-end secure communication scheme will be used
</br>
</br>

## Phase III: Developing software to communicate with other clients</br>
