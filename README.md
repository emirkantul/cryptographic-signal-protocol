# cryptographic-signal-protocol
  
  Sabanci University cryptography project to develop a simplified version of the Signal Protocol, which provides forward secrecy and deniability. This project will insight for a practical cryptographic protocol, a variant of which is used in different applications such as WhatsApp.

The project has three phases:</br>
**Phase I** Developing software for the Public Key Registration
**Phase II** Developing software for receiving messages from other clients 
**Phase III** Developing software to communicate with other clients


**Phase I: Developing software for the Public Key Registration**
In this protocol, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used in key exchange protocol and digital signature algorithm with NIST-256 curve. You should select “secp256k1” for the elliptic curve in your python code. There are three types of public keys; Identity Key (IK), Signed Pre-key (SPK) and One-time Pre-key (OTK).

**Phase II: Developing software for receiving messages from other clients**


**Phase III: Developing software to communicate with other clients**
